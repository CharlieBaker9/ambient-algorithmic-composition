# ambient-algorithmic-composition

In this project I expanded upon Brian Eno's Music for Airports to create ambient music algorithmically.
I utilized sounds from choirs, pianos, and singing bowls from around the world.
I was only able to upload a short segment of the resulting audio file, but please enjoy!
